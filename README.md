# Super-resolution-of-Astronomy-images-

Have downloaded a dataset of 200 astronomy images from Hubble's Galaxies (science.nasa.gov.in) 
Created 200 corresponding noise images using PSF(Point Spread Function)
Point Spread Function:
To add gaussian noise to our image
Due to diffraction, lens aberration and image sensing psf appears like a gaussian function
h(x,y)= (1/(2*pi*sigma**2)*exp((x**2 + y**2)/2a**2)
